# FSIX - Frictionless Secure Information eXchange

## Frictionless Secure Information eXchange

Got a problem sharing PHI (or any sensitive information) with a coworker, in a secure, HIPAA-compliant way? FSIX is a web app where you can upload sensitive information and share it with other users. FSIX will keep the information for a limited time (up to 2 weeks) and then delete it. If you need something stored longer than that, then this is not the droid you're looking for---talk to IT about setting up a SharePoint team site or a shared network folder.

BTW, FSIX is pronounced like "F6".

## How It Works

Alice needs to send a report to Bob, but the report contains Protected Health Information, and company policy prohibits sending PHI by email or IM. Alice could have IS set up a network folder or SharePoint workspace for this "project" and set permissions so only she and Bob have access, but those solutions are overkill. Too much friction. This is a short-term interaction that needs a low-friction solution---the electronic equivalent of sending a paper document by fax or courier.

That's where FSIX comes in. Alice quickly creates a "share", shares it with Bob, and uploads the report. Bob gets a notification email with a link that takes him to FSIX, and the file is right there waiting to be downloaded. A little while later, FSIX automatically deletes its copy of the file, leaving behind nothing but an audit log.

Sending a file with FSIX is almost as quick and easy as sending an email with a file attached, but it's more secure.
